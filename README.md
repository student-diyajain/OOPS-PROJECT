# OOPS-PROJECT
This repository contains a collection of Java-based console applications developed using core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction. Each project focuses on solving real-world problems by modeling them through classes and objects in Java.

*ATM_MACHINE
A console-based simulation of an ATM system that allows users to perform operations like balance inquiry, deposit, and withdrawal using OOP principles.

*CAR_RENTAL_SYSTEM
Java-based application that enables car booking, return, and billing. Demonstrates use of classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation for managing rental details.

*CAR_SHOWROOM
Console program to manage a car showroomâ€™s inventory. Allows viewing, adding, updating, and removing car entries. Uses constructors, abstraction, and collection classes.

*EMPLOYEE_PAYROLL_SYSTEM
A simple payroll system that calculates employee salaries based on input parameters. Includes features like salary slips, hours worked, and employee records using OOP concepts.
